\title{Function to evaluate fitness of chromosomes.}
\usage{
evaluate_fitness(generation_t0, Y, X, family, nCores, minimize,
  objective_function, rank_objective_function)
}
\arguments{
\item{generation_t0}{a matrix of parent chromosomes to be evaluated. Columns correspond to predictors/genes and rows correspond to parents/chromosomes.}

\item{Y}{vector of response variable}

\item{X}{a matrix or dataframe of predictor variables}

\item{family}{a character string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is gaussian.}

\item{nCores}{an integer indicating number of parallel processes to run when evaluating fitness. See \code{\link{evaluate_fitness}} and details below.}

\item{minimize}{a logical value indicating whether optimize should be minimized (TRUE) or maximized (FALSE).}

\item{objective_function}{function for computing objective. Default is \code{\link{AIC}}. User can specify custom function.}

\item{rank_objective_function}{a function that ranks parents by their fitness as determined by optimize criteria.

This function uses \code{\link{mclapply}} to parallel processess. User can specify number of cores to use, with a maximum number of cores equal to output of \code{\link{detectCores}}. Parallel processing is set to preschedule by default; dynamic parallelization is not available at this time.}
}
\description{
This function uses default or user supplied ojective functions, rank functions, to evaluate fitness of a generation chromosomes. This process can be parallized if \code{nCores > 1}. Parallel operations uses \code{\link{mclapply}} to parallelize operations. Max number of parallel operations is determined by \code{\link{detectCores}}. Prescheduling = TRUE is only option for compuations. It is advised to only use parallelization if inputed a large dataframe with great than 1000 oberations and/or predictors.
