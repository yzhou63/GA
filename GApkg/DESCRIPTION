Description: Functions that do variabel selection using genetic algorithm and test data set. 
  To perform feature selection in regression problems using genetic algorithm, we conduct the following stepssequentially: 
  initialization, evaluatation, selection (crossover and mutation), and looping and termination.Based on Basic_Cam_4.R.
